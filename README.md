MisoBot's LastFM Cog Ported to Red

This is a port of [MisoBot's last.fm cog](https://github.com/joinemm/miso-bot/blob/master/cogs/lastfm.py), with some functionality removed or added and made to use config.

Since the port, the cog has been split up into multiple files and many new features have been added. Feel free to make an issue if you have any ideas for new features.

## setup
- Visit the [LastFM](https://www.last.fm/api/) website and click on 'Get an API Account'.
- Fill in the application. Once completed do not exit the page.
- Copy all information on the page and save it.
- Enter the api key via `[p]set api lastfm appid <appid_here>`
- Enter the api secret via `[p]set api lastfm secret <secret_here>`
